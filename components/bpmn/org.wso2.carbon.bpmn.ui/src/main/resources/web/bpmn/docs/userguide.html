<h1>WSO2 BPMN Component User Guide</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    The Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI) has developed a standard Business Process Modeling Notation
    (BPMN). The BPMN 2.0 specification was released to the public in January, 2011. We have integrated BPMN to BPS
    server byusingthe Activiti engine which is a light-weight workflow and Business Process Management (BPM) Platform
    targeted at business people, developers and system admins. It's open-source and distributed under the Apache
    license. Activiti runs in any Java application, on a server, on a cluster or in the cloud. It is extremely
    lightweight and based on simple concepts.

<h2><a name="upload">Managing BPMN Artifacts</a></h2>

<p>As highlighted in the diagram below in red, you can upload BPMN artifacts (.bar extension) by navigating through Main
    -> Add BPMN</p>

<p>Once you uploaded the artifact successfully you can navigate to the BPMN deployed Processes list and view the
    deployed processes.
</p>

<p>When you click on the package name you will be directed to a page to undeploy the package if necessary.</p>

<p>When you click on the Start link, there will be instance created for that particular process.</p>

<p>When you click on the Process ID you will be directed to Process Information page which contains the process details,
    process diagram and process definition.</p>

<p>In-order to view the BPMN process instances created, navigate to BPMN instances from the left side navigation panel
    as shown in the caption below.</p>

<p>You will be able to suspend/activate or delete instances in the Manage section.</p>

<h2><a name="rest">Using BPMN REST service</a></h2>

<p>In-order to access the BPMN rest service, you can use the following url pattern:
    https://localhost:9443/bpmn/{serviceName} with respective authentication (default username: admin and password:
    admin) headers.</p>
